      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>I am Jianchao Li, a software engineer specialized in computer vision. I received my bachelor's degree from the <a href="http://www.ustb.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology Beijing</a> (USTB) in 2013 and my master's degree from the <a href="http://www.ucas.edu.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (UCAS) in 2016. During my master study, I worked in the <a href="http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/">Visual Information Processing and Learning</a> (VIPL) group at the <a href="http://www.ict.ac.cn/">Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (ICT, CAS) with Professor <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ&hl=en">Shiguang Shan</a>, on <b>applying deep learning to computer vision</b> and completed two projects for the <a href="http://research.baidu.com/institute-of-deep-learning/">Baidu Institute of Deep Learning</a>.</p>

      After graduation, I joined <a href="https://www.indeed.com">Indeed</a> - the world's #1 job site as a software engineer in October 2016 and transitioned to a site reliability engineer in October 2017. After spending 17 wonderful months there, I came back to China in February 2018. I first spent about half a year at <a href="http://jeejio.com/en">Jeejio</a>, a start-up in Beijing, leading its algorithm team. Later I joined the <a href="http://ailab.bytedance.com/">ByteDance AI Lab</a> and spent another 6 months there, working on computer vision and advertising.
