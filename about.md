### Biography

I am **Jianchao Li**, an algorithm engineer at [ByteDance AI Lab](http://ailab.bytedance.com/), working on computer vision. Before that, I spent about half a year at [Jeejio](http://jeejio.com/en), a start-up in Beijing, leading its algorithm team. Earlier, I worked as a software engineer and a site reliability engineer for the world's #1 job site - [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com) for around 17 months. 

I hold a Master Degree from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ucas.edu.cn/) (UCAS). During my Master study, I worked in the [Visual Information Processing and Learning](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/) (VIPL) group at the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn/) (ICT, CAS) with Professor [Shiguang Shan](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ&hl=en), on applying deep learning to computer vision and completed two projects for the [Baidu Institute of Deep Learning](http://research.baidu.com/institute-of-deep-learning/). Earlier, I obtained my Bachelor Degree from the [University of Science and Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/) (USTB). 

I love programming and I have ever spent several months solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). And I ended up being the user with the second most-reputation.
